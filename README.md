# BrickBreakerGame
Used Java Swing to create this game which includes graphics like ball, a sliderboard that moves by the arrow buttons and which holds the ball, and some bricks. As the ball touches the bricks, points get added to score. If ball falls below the slider-board, it should display "Game Over"
